My name is Jeremie and I make internet. This is my first attempt at blogging so we'll see how things end up. I'll be writing about front-end development to start and I may bring some other topics in as time goes on. 

Just making this site has been a fun experiment. Posts are written in [Markdown](http://daringfireball.net/projects/markdown/), spit out in to static templates using [Jekyll](http://jekyllrb.com/), and pushed out on to [Github Pages](http://pages.github.com/). Thanks to [@anna_debenham](https://twitter.com/anna_debenham) for her article on [24Ways](http://24ways.org/2013/get-started-with-github-pages/) for the inspiration I needed to try out Jekyll.

This site is a work in progress so I'll be making changes as I go along (like adding comments), but I want to get this show on the road! I hope it ends up being useful and/or interesting to you, dear reader. Thank you.
