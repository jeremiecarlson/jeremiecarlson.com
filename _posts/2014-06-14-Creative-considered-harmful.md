Creative as a noun needs to die. 

The word is currently abused in a variety of ways. Got a design question? Just ask Creative. The site will really pop when Creative gets a chance work on it. Did you get a chance to look at the Creative? We've got 3 weeks blocked off for Creative here.

Creative seems to be used in two main ways: the products of a designer, and the role of designer itself. Both use cases suffer from the same key fault. By appropriating an adjective that could be ascribed to any noun, you've necessarily created a situation where nothing else can be called creative. 

This, seemingly subtle, shift in meaning has a couple of insidious effects. First, by changing what work or product can be called creative, the implication is that no other work can be considered creative. No creativity in copy. No creativity in user experience. No creativity in code.

Perhaps worse than just implying that some produced piece of work lacks creativity, the issue becomes more acutely personal when applied to a person's job title or some similar proxy. Not only has the person's work been questioned, but now we've been able to deduce whether someone is capable of creative thought simply by job function. Hey, I'm pretty sure I met some spectacularly creative coders at [Eyeo](http://eyeofestival.com/) this week, but apparently it's just a figment of my imagination.

No one has a monopoly on creativity. Stop insulting your colleagues.
